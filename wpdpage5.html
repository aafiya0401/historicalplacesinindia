			<div><p>The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. 
			It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, 
			the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD.</p></div>

			<div><p>The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, 
			is the main gate which stands majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt.
		 	The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the 
			galleries is subdivided into four quarters by two main walk-ways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the walled in garden. 
			The enclosure walls on the east and west have a pavilion at the centre.</p></div>

			<div><p>On the Southern side of the Taj Mahal is Taj Ganj which a part of Agra that is full of many hotels and rooftop restaurants. This is a great area of the city to visit for a midday snack or even afternoon beer on a rooftop with views of the nearby Taj Mahal. 
			Some restaurants have better views than others, and no matter where you go, there will probably be some buildings in your line of sight. But we still think that eating a snack or drinking coffee with a view of a world wonder is a pretty magical experience.
			Some of our favorite rooftop spots include Stuff Makers on top of Hotel Kamal and Saniya Palace located on top of the Saniya Hotel. The food at Hotel Kamal is slightly higher quality than that of Saniya Palace and Stuff Makers, but both offer great views with Indian and Western food options.</p></div>
