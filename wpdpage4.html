			<div><p>Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi)
			located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The town of Amer and the Amber Fort were originally built by Raja Man 
			Singh and additions were, later, made by Sawai Jai Singh. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur.Amber Fort
 			is known for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake, 
			which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.</p></div>

			<div><p>Amber Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal architecture. 
			Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the
			Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, 
			and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amber
 			Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.The palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to 
			the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a Goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja
			Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh).Raja Man Singh had 12 queens so he made 12 
			rooms, one for each Queen. Each room had a staircase connected to the King’s room but the Queens were not to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had
			only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen’s rooms.</p></div>

			<div><p>This palace, along with Jaigarh Fort, is located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the same Aravalli 
			range of hills. The palace and Jaigarh Fort are considered one complex, as the two are connected by a subterranean passage. This passage 
			was meant as an escape route in times of war to enable the royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more
 			redoubtable Jaigarh Fort.Annual tourist visitation to the Amer Palace was reported by the Superintendent of the Department of 
			Archaeology and Museums as 5000 visitors a day, with 1.4 million visitors during 2007. At the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee
			held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2013, Amer Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part
			of the group Hill Forts of Rajasthan.</p></div>

			<div><p>The Palace is divided into six separate but main sections each with its own entry gate and courtyard. The main entry is through 
			the Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) which leads to the first main courtyard. This was the place where armies would hold victory parades with their 
			war bounty on their return from battles, which were also witnessed by the Royal family's womenfolk through the latticed windows.
			This gate was built exclusively[clarification needed] and was provided with guards as it was the main entry into the palace. It faced east
			towards the rising sun, hence the name. Royal cavalcades and dignitaries entered the palace through this gate.</p></div>

			<div><p>An impressive stairway from Jalebi Chowk leads into the main palace grounds. Here, at the entrance to the right of the stairway steps 
			is the Sila Devi temple where the Rajput Maharajas worshipped, starting with Maharaja Mansingh in the 16th century until the 1980s, when the
			animal sacrifice ritual (sacrifice of a buffalo) practiced by the royalty was stopped.

			Ganesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, named after the Hindu god Lord Ganesh, who removes all obstacles in life, is the entry into the private 
			palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that were also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh
			(1621–1627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies of the royal family used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through 
			latticed marble windows called "jâlîs".</p></div>

			widht="100pixels" height="200pixels" border=45></div>
			<div><p>On the right side of the Jalebi Chowk, there is a small but an elegant temple called the Sila Devi temple (Sila Devi was an 
			incarnation of Kali or Durga). The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity 
			inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh 
			sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to 
			retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from
 			the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, 
			there is also a carving of Lord Ganesha, which is made out of a single piece of coral.

			Another version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone 
			slab which was said to have a link to the Mahabharata epic story in which Kansa had killed older siblings of Lord Krishna on this stone. 
			In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of 
			Durga Mahishasuramardini, who had slain the demon king Mahishasura and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was 
			worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of 
			Ramgarh.</p></div>
			
			<div><p><h2><u>Second courtyard</u></h2></p></div>
			<div><p>The second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. 
			Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped 
			capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.
			
			<div><p><h2><u>Third courtyard</u></h2></p></div>

			<div><p>The third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered 
			through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the 
			other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the Mughal Gardens. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir,
			which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with 
			colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), 
			the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a "glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight".Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in 
			the 16th century and completed in 1727. It is also the foundation year of Jaipur state.However, most of this work was allowed to 
			deteriorate during the period 1970–80 but has since then been in the process of restoration and renovation. The walls around the hall hold 
			carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.

			On top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and alabaster relief work.

			The other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). 
			This hall is approached through a sandalwood door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called "chînî khâna". A piped 
			water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. 
			The water from this channel flows into the garden.</p></div>

			<div><p><h2><u>Fourth courtyard</u></h2></p></div>
			<div><p>The fourth courtyard is where the Zenana (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many 
			living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was 
			visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.</p></div>

			<div><p><h2><u>Palace of Man Singh</u></h2></p></div>

			widht="100pixels" height="200pixels" border=20></div>
			<div><p>South of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.The palace took 25 years to 
			build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589–1614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the 
			palace is the pillared baradari or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion 
			(which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this 
			pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with 
			many temples, palatial houses and mosques.</p></div>
