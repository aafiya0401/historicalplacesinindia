<h3><b></b></h3>
			<h4><li>The Qutub Minar complex is open daily from sunrise until sunset.</li></h4>
			<h4><li> The complex does get crowded during the day, and especially on weekends. Hence, those who arrive early in the morning will not only get rewarded with the monument being illuminated sun's first rays but also relative peace.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>Cash tickets now cost 40 rupees for Indians, or 35 rupees cashless. Foreigners pay 600 rupees cash, or 550 rupees cashless. Children under 15 years of age can enter for free.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>Do note that food isn't allowed inside the Qutub Minar complex.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>Do be aware that security guards may approach you and offer to take your photo. They will expect payment for doing so (100 rupees) but they know places for some great shots that you probably won't have thought of.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>The entrance fees for Indians are INR 30 while for the foreigners it is INR 500.</li></h4>
