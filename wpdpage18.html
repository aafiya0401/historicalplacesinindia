			<div><p>The construction of the Qutub Minar was started by Qitub-ud-Din Aibak, but he only constructed the basement. The construction of the tower was later taken over by his successor Iltutmish who constructed three more stories. The last two storeys were completed Firoz Shah Tuglak. The different architectural styles from the time of Aibak to Tuglak are clearly visible in the Qutub Minar.</p></div>

<p>The story of Qutub Minar is as diverse and layered as India’s history and culture. The Qutub complex, which also houses the Alai Darwaza, Quwwatu'l-Islam mosque and the Iron pillar, showcases the coexistence of the architectural heritage and styles of various faiths—sometimes a harmonious blend and a hasty juxtaposition at others. The construction of the minar was started in 1198 BCE by Qutubu’d-din Aibak, the mamluk (slave) commander-in-chief of Muhammad of Ghori, and founder of Muslim rule in India. </p>

<p>Around 300 years later, in 1803, the tower again suffered severe damages in an earthquake. Major Robert Smith, a member of the British Indian Army, mended the structure in 1828. He went ahead and installed a pillared cupola to sit atop the fifth story, thus lending the tower its sixth story. But this extra story was removed in 1848 under the orders of Henry Hardinge, the then Governor-General of India, and reinstalled next to the minaret. Entry to the tower has been restricted since 1981 after an accident, which left 47 people inside it dead.</p>
