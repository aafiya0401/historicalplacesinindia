			<div><p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jaipur, India.[1] He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.</p></div>

			<div><p>The royal class has always had its own way of doing things, and so did the royal ladies of Jaipur. Jaipur is also one of the most popular historic places in India. Belonging to royalty required them to observe the “purdah” system constantly. However, they were also curious about the happenings of the outside world. To satisfy this curiosity, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh had the Hawa Mahal built for them.</p></div>

Cool fountains greeted us as we stepped into the palace. The pretty spray played tricks on my mind’s eye. I was transported back to its glorious era where the royal ladies played Holi in the pool and ran around squealing through the corridor. Sharad in Hindi refers to “Autumn” and the reason this name was given to the floor is for the festivities that came with Sharad Purnima (a harvest festival).</p></div>

			<div><p>Ascending to Level 3 – Vichitra Mandir of Hawamahal Jaipur
Vichitra means unknown or weird. The floor was so named as the doors were kept closed and the floor was an escape for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh. It is said that he was so devoted to Lord Krishna that he spent a lot of time on this floor, behind the closed doors, composing poems and singing in praise of the Lord. This floor was the”ME” corner for the Maharaja.</p></div>
