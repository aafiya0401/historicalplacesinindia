	<br><h3 align="center"><u>1) Taj Mahal - The crown of the palace</u></h3></a>
	<h4 align="center">In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, <br> a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. Foreign tourists have to pay 1100 INR + 200 INR.</h4>

	<br><h3 align="center"><u>3) Hawa Mahal - the chef-d'œuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh</u></h3></a>
	<h4 align="center">The monument stands upright because of its pyramidal shape. Its distinctive rosy colour, which is because of the natural sandstone, <br>is the reason behind Jaipur getting its nickname, .i.e., the Pink City.</h4>
