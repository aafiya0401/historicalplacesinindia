<h3><b>It's certainly the most iconic landmark in Jaipur. The building's evocative facade, with all those little windows, never fails to arouse curiosity. This complete guide to the Hawa Mahal will tell you everything you need to know about it and how to visit it.</b></h3>
			<h4><li>Some tourists don't realize it's possible to go in because they don't see an entrance. This is because the Hawa Mahal is a wing of the City Palace. To access it, you'll need to go around the back and approach it from a different street.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>The admission price is 50 rupees for Indians and 200 rupees for foreigners. A composite ticket is available for those who are planning to do a lot of sightseeing. </li></h4>
			<h4><li>Entry to the Hawa Mahal is free on four days of the year: Rajastha Diwas (30 March), World Heritage Day (18 April), International Museum Day (18 May) and World Tourism Day (27 September).</li></h4>
			<h4><li>The Hawa Mahal is open from 9 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. daily.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>You'll come across plenty of shops selling the usual tourist fare, such as clothing and textiles, around the Hawa Mahal.</li></h4>
			<h4><li>The Indian Coffee House restaurant chain is the largest in India. It dates way back to the 1930s, when the British set it up to increase coffee consumption and sell their coffee crops.</li></h4>
